## Connecting to Cassandra 
This section describes how Spark connects to Cassandra and 
how to execute CQL statements from Spark applications.

### Preparing `SparkContext` to work with Cassandra

To connect your Spark application to Cassandra, set connection options in the 
`SparkConf` object. These are prefixed with `spark.` so that they can be recognized
from the spark-shell and set within the $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-default.conf.

Example:

```scala
val conf = new SparkConf(true)
        .set("spark.cassandra.connection.host", "192.168.123.10")
        .set("spark.cassandra.auth.username", "cassandra")            
        .set("spark.cassandra.auth.password", "cassandra")

val sc = new SparkContext("spark://192.168.123.10:7077", "test", conf)
```

Multiple hosts can be passed in using a comma separated list ("127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2"). These are the initial
contact points only, all nodes in the local DC will be used upon connecting. 

See the reference section for a full list of options
[Cassandra Connection Parameters](reference.md#cassandra-connection-parameters)


To import Cassandra-specific functions on `SparkContext` and `RDD` objects, call:

```scala
import com.datastax.spark.connector._                                    
```

Query retry delay can be configured in few different ways:
* `<delay in ms>` - for a constant delay before each retry
* `<initial delay in ms>+<increase in ms>` - for a linearly increasing delay - delay before each retry
  will be longer than the delay before the previous retry by increase factor
* `<initial delay in ms>*<increase multiplier, float>` - for an exponentially increasing delay - delay 
  before each retry will be as many times longer than the previous retry delay as specified 
  by the multiplier

### Connection management

Whenever you call a method requiring access to Cassandra, the options in the `SparkConf` object will be used
to create a new connection or to borrow one already open from the global connection cache. 
The initial contact node given in
`spark.cassandra.connection.host` can be any node of the cluster. The driver will fetch the cluster topology from 
the contact node and will always try to connect to the closest node in the same data center. If possible, 
connections are established to the same node the task is running on. Consequently, good locality of data can be achieved and the amount 
of data sent across the network is minimized. 

Connections are never made to data centers other than the data center of `spark.cassandra.connection.host`.
If some nodes in the local data center are down and a read or write operation fails, the operation won't be retried on nodes in
a different data center. This technique guarantees proper workload isolation so that a huge analytics job won't disturb
the realtime part of the system.

Connections are cached internally. If you call two methods needing access to the same Cassandra cluster 
quickly, one after another, or in parallel from different threads, they will share the same logical connection 
represented by the underlying Java Driver `Cluster` object.  

Eventually, when all the tasks needing Cassandra connectivity terminate,
the connection to the Cassandra cluster will be closed shortly thereafter. The period of time for keeping unused connections
open is controlled by the global `spark.cassandra.connection.keep_alive_ms` system property, which defaults to 250 ms. 


### Connecting manually to Cassandra

If you ever need to manually connect to Cassandra in order to issue some CQL statements, 
this driver offers a handy `CassandraConnector` class which can be initialized from the `SparkConf` object
and provides access to the `Cluster` and `Session` objects. `CassandraConnector` instances are serializable
and therefore can be safely used in lambdas passed to Spark transformations.

Assuming an appropriately configured `SparkConf` object is stored in the `conf` variable, the following
code creates a keyspace and a table:

```scala
import com.datastax.spark.connector.cql.CassandraConnector

CassandraConnector(conf).withSessionDo { session =>
  session.execute("CREATE KEYSPACE test2 WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1 }")
  session.execute("CREATE TABLE test2.words (word text PRIMARY KEY, count int)")
}
```

### Connecting to multiple Cassandra Clusters

The Spark Cassandra Connector is able to connect to multiple Cassandra Clusters for all of it's 
normal operations. The default `CassandraConnector` object used by calls to `sc.cassandraTable` and
`saveToCassandra` is specified by the `SparkConfiguration`. If you would like to use multiple clusters,
an implicit `CassandraConnector` can be used in a code block to specify the target cluster for all
operations in that block.

####Example of reading from one cluster and writing to another

```scala
import com.datastax.spark.connector._
import com.datastax.spark.connector.cql._

import org.apache.spark.SparkContext


def twoClusterExample ( sc: SparkContext) = {
  val connectorToClusterOne = CassandraConnector(sc.getConf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.host", "127.0.0.1"))
  val connectorToClusterTwo = CassandraConnector(sc.getConf.set("spark.cassandra.connection.host", "127.0.0.2"))

  val rddFromClusterOne = {
    // Sets connectorToClusterOne as default connection for everything in this code block
    implicit val c = connectorToClusterOne
    sc.cassandraTable("ks","tab")
  }

  {
    //Sets connectorToClusterTwo as the default connection for everything in this code block
    implicit val c = connectorToClusterTwo
    rddFromClusterOne.saveToCassandra("ks","tab")
  }

}
```
